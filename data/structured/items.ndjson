Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics.

We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass.

Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective.

While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention.

Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2).

Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting.   Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $γ_n^{1/6}$, where $γ_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$.

Empirically, on task-incremental diffusion image generation and continual diffusion-policy control, trust region continual learning achieves the best final performance and retention, and consistently recovers early-task performance faster than EWC, replay, and continual meta-learning baselines.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种信任区域持续学习方法，结合生成重放和Fisher度量约束，显著提高了模型在连续学习中的性能和任务保留能力。", "keywords": ["信任区域持续学习", "元学习", "生成回放", "任务增量", "深度学习", "机器学习", "神经网络", "任务优化", "性能保留", "ml"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Zekun Wang", "Anant Gupta", "Christopher J.

While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection.", "description_zh": "提出了一种新的主动学习种子数据选择方法ATBagging，结合了迁移学习和袋装模型，以提高数据获取效率。", "keywords": ["主动学习", "迁移学习", "数据集", "信息增益", "特征选择", "Active-Transfer Bagging", "低数据场景", "预测分布", "多样性采样", "machine learning"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Vivienne Pelletier", "Daniel J.

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient.

In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result.

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant.

While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种名为PULSE的高效稀疏权重同步方法，显著减少了带宽需求，同时保持训练性能。", "keywords": ["权重更新稀疏性", "强化学习", "分布式RL", "大语言模型", "PULSE", "通信效率", "参数同步", "训练动态", "带宽约束", "llm"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Erfan Miahi", "Eugene Belilovsky"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "llm", "rag"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 25, "bonus": 5, "business": 14, "penalty": 0, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "项目提出了PULSE方法，展现出强大的自我改进能力和数据反馈机制，符合AI原生标准。技术路径解决了带宽瓶颈问题，具备可持续的行业壁垒。商业模式与高价值用户紧密结合，团队背景信息不足，未能加分。", "total": 72}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "PULSE在带宽限制的去中心化环境中实现了超过100倍的通信减少，保持了与全权重同步相同的训练动态和性能。", "method": "PULSE方法通过传输修改参数的索引和值，利用权重更新的稀疏性，避免了浮点数漂移和传输错误。", "motivation": "在带宽受限的分布式强化学习中，策略权重的同步常成为扩展性的瓶颈，尤其是在商品网络或去中心化环境中。", "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为PULSE的高效稀疏权重同步方法，显著减少了带宽需求，同时保持训练性能。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-03T18:56:48Z", "tagline": null}}

To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods.

Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts.

A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines.

Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization.

Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression.

We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\\sqrt{m})$ in expectation.

This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan.

We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels.

To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers.

We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning.

Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种新颖的邻域描述符LitS，用于准确表征点云的局部几何特征。", "keywords": ["点云", "邻域描述符", "3D扫描", "几何特征", "LitS", "机器学习", "深度学习", "语义搜索", "自适应算法", "数据分析", "rag"], "tags": ["cs.CV"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Jonatan B.

In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction.

Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning.

Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster.

We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments.

The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF).

Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking.

However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method.

Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck.

A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions.

These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects.

Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy.

To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.", "description_zh": "本研究提出了一种地理感知的基于Transformer的交通预测模型，以提高城市高速公路的交通预测准确性。", "keywords": ["深度学习", "Transformer", "交通预测", "数字双胞胎", "时序数据", "地理信息", "实时数据", "机器学习", "预测模型"], "tags": ["cs.AI"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Krešimir Kušić", "Vinny Cahill", "Ivana Dusparic"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "machine learning", "transformer"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 20, "bonus": 0, "business": 12, "penalty": 5, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "该项目在AI原生程度上表现一般，虽然提出了新模型，但缺乏自我改进机制。技术路径具有独特性，解决复杂问题，商业模式较弱且未明确高价值用户。团队背景信息不足，减分因创始人早于1990年。", "total": 65}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "实验结果表明，使用互信息增强地理感知可以提高GATTF模型的预测准确性，相较于标准Transformer模型，复杂度未增加。", "method": "提出的GATTF模型利用分布式传感器之间的互信息来捕捉地理关系，改善交通预测性能。", "motivation": "高速公路数字双胞胎技术的有效性依赖于高分辨率实时交通数据的持续流动，同时需结合预测的交通状况以支持决策。", "tldr": "本研究提出了一种地理感知的基于Transformer的交通预测模型，以提高城市高速公路的交通预测准确性。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-05T18:33:03Z", "tagline": null}}

In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference.

These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines.

We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench.

To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects.

Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge.

By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \\textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种名为Context Forcing的新框架，通过长上下文教师训练长上下文学生，从而提升视频生成的一致性和有效性。", "keywords": ["视频生成", "长期一致性", "上下文管理", "深度学习", "生成模型", "长期依赖", "Slow-Fast Memory", "训练框架", "监督匹配", "rag"], "tags": ["cs.CV"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Shuo Chen", "Cong Wei", "Sun Sun", "Ping Nie", "Kai Zhou", "Ge Zhang", "Ming-Hsuan Yang", "Wenhu Chen"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "rag", "context"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 20, "bonus": 6, "business": 12, "penalty": 0, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "该项目在视频生成领域提出了长上下文教师的创新方法，具备一定的自我改进能力，技术路径独特，符合行业需求，但商业模式尚不明确，团队信息不足。", "total": 68}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "实验结果显示，该方法在生成超过20秒的长视频时，显著超越了现有技术，提升了长时间一致性。", "method": "Context Forcing框架通过引入长上下文教师，消除监督不匹配，并使用Slow-Fast Memory架构来管理和优化上下文处理。", "motivation": "现有视频生成方法存在学生与教师之间的短期和长期上下文不匹配问题，限制了模型的生成能力。", "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为Context Forcing的新框架，通过长上下文教师训练长上下文学生，从而提升视频生成的一致性和有效性。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-05T18:58:01Z", "tagline": null}}

Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation.

The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model.

In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference.

These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods.

Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines.

We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench.

To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects.

Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency.

However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects.

In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference.

These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines.

We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving.

Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects.

We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective.

Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation.

The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model.

In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy.

Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants.

Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces.

We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories.

Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture.

During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction.

We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models.

We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate.

True intelligence relies on \"world models\" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations.

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network.

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy.

However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain.", "description_zh": "提出了一种名为GAD-MoRE的框架，通过混合黎曼专家实现零-shot图异常检测，显著提升跨域泛化能力。", "keywords": ["图神经网络", "异常检测", "零-shot学习", "里曼专家", "多曲率特征对齐", "结构签名", "跨域泛化", "动态路由", "机器学习", "深度学习", "embedding"], "tags": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Xinyu Zhao", "Qingyun Sun", "Jiayi Luo", "Xingcheng Fu", "Jianxin Li"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "embedding"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 20, "bonus": 6, "business": 12, "penalty": 0, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "项目提出了创新的混合黎曼专家框架，提升了图异常检测的跨域泛化能力，具备一定的技术壁垒。但缺乏明确的商业模式和团队背景信息，整体评分受限。", "total": 70}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "GAD-MoRE在零-shot设置下显著超越了现有的通用图异常检测基线，甚至超过了在目标领域用标签数据进行少量微调的竞争对手。", "method": "GAD-MoRE利用多个专门的黎曼专家网络在不同曲率空间中建模异常模式，并引入异常感知的多曲率特征对齐模块和基于记忆的动态路由器以优化输入分配。", "motivation": "现有零-shot图异常检测方法未能充分考虑不同异常模式的几何差异，限制了其跨域泛化能力。", "tldr": "提出了一种名为GAD-MoRE的框架，通过混合黎曼专家实现零-shot图异常检测，显著提升跨域泛化能力。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-06T16:46:30Z", "tagline": null}}

In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{RoBoS}}$-NN.

We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance.

In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy.

To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping.

Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants.

Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces.

In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy.

To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories.

Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction.

Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking.

Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection.

While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations.

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network.

We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset.

Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance.

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining.

However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies.

We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution.

Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions.

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference.

In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture.

On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model.

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima.

Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations.

While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment.

This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency.

In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process.

Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.   Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation.

In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases.

It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping.

On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model.

To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF).

While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error.

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.", "description_zh": "研究表明，二元自编码器（bAE）在QUBO优化问题中能够更有效地重构可行解，从而提升优化效率。", "keywords": ["二进制自编码器", "组合优化", "量子退火", "机器学习", "深度学习", "神经网络", "最优解", "旅行推销员问题", "近似比率", "潜在表示", "agent"], "tags": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "quant-ph"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Tetsuro Abe", "Masashi Yamashita", "Shu Tanaka"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 18, "bonus": 6, "business": 10, "penalty": 0, "team": 8, "tech_niche": 20}, "reason": "项目在组合优化领域具有技术创新，但缺乏明确的商业模式和团队背景信息，AI原生程度较低，主要依赖于现有的量子计算和机器学习技术。", "total": 62}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "bAE结合FMQA能够更快提高近似比，同时保持可行性，且其几何特性为黑箱优化中的潜在表示设计提供了指导。", "method": "通过使用小型旅行推销员问题作为测试平台，研究bAE在优化过程中的表现，并与手动设计的编码进行比较。", "motivation": "在黑箱组合优化中，寻求高质量解的同时需控制评估成本，因此有效的编码方式至关重要。", "tldr": "研究表明，二元自编码器（bAE）在QUBO优化问题中能够更有效地重构可行解，从而提升优化效率。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-10T17:59:29Z", "tagline": null}}

From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure.

The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework.

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection.

However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data.

While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%.

The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget.

MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms.

However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset.

As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster).

We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers.

In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks.

Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism.

Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning.

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation.

To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation.

However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes.

We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities.

However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations.

We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model.

The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism.

While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory.

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models.

This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation.

However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method.

Agent included** — Tambo runs the LLM conversation loop for you. Bring your own API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, or any OpenAI-compatible provider). Works with agent frameworks like LangChain and Mastra, but they're not required.\n*2. Streaming infrastructure** — Props stream to your components as the LLM generates them. Cancellation, error recovery, and reconnection are handled for you.\n*3. Tambo Cloud or self-host** — Cloud is a hosted backend that manages conversation state and agent orchestration. Self-hosted runs the same backend on your infrastructure via Docker.\nMost software is built around a one-size-fits-all mental model. We built Tambo to help developers build software that adapts to users.\nGet Started\n*Tambo Cloud** is a hosted backend, free to get started with plenty of credits to start building. **Self-hosted** runs on your own infrastructure.\nCheck out the pre-built component library for agent and gener", "translated_description": "React 的生成式 UI SDK。\n\n主要功能：将大模型的结构化/流式输出映射为可交互的 React 组件，支持工具/函数调用、状态与事件管理，以及与后端动作的协作执行。目标用户/场景：为前端/全栈开发者构建 AI 助手、智能表单与工作流、数据探索和问答界面等。核心技术：React 与 TypeScript，LLM（如 OpenAI/Anthropic），JSON/JSON Schema 结构化输出与工具调用，结合客户端/服务端协同渲染与提示编排。", "readme_summary_zh": "Tambo 是面向 React 的开源生成式 UI 工具包，帮助开发者构建能用自然语言驱动界面的智能代理，前端/全栈团队可将现有组件“接入”对话体验。其核心技术包括以 Zod 定义组件契约、LLM 会话循环与代理执行、流式 props 传输与状态管理、MCP 支持，并兼容多家模型提供商（OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/Mistral 等）且可云端或自托管。典型场景如“按地区查看销售额”自动渲染图表、“添加任务”直接更新清单，亦可与 LangChain、Mastra 配合但非必需。"}}

However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations.

Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds.

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation.

Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth.

Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update.

Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors.

Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction.

Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow.

Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...", "description_zh": "提出一种面向体育与舞台表演的“时间可归档”相机虚拟化神经渲染方法，在动态快速运动场景中实现更时空一致、逼真的新视角合成，并支持回看任意历史时刻重渲染。", "keywords": ["相机虚拟化", "新视角合成", "神经体渲染", "动态场景渲染", "时空一致性", "时间归档渲染", "体育赛事转播", "多视角同步相机", "刚体变换建模", "三维高斯泼溅", "非刚体快速运动"], "tags": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.RO"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Yunxiao Zhang", "William Stone", "Suryansh Kumar"]}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"is_ai": true, "hit_keywords": ["ai"], "hit_excludes": []}, "score": {"total": 29, "breakdown": {"ai_native": 6, "tech_niche": 14, "business": 4, "team": 3, "bonus": 2, "penalty": 0}, "reason": "偏论文级神经渲染方法，无用户-数据标注闭环、在线自进化与确定性交付工作流。体育/演出time-archival新视角合成有一定niche技术亮点，但私有数据飞轮与商业化/团队信息不足。", "reason_struct": {"summary": "科研方法创新>产品与商业闭环；niche存在但护城河与落地不明。", "plus": ["面向体育/演出快动态的time-archival相机虚拟化，场景较垂直", "尝试绕开3DGS依赖SfM点云与多主体运动跟踪假设的限制"], "minus": ["无将用户结构性转为标注员的数据飞轮设计，难以反哺模型", "无online learning/self-improvement闭环与跨用户经验迁移描述", "非Agent工作流：缺少规划/工具调用/重试闭环等确定性交付能力", "商业模式、付费绑定与exit路径未提供；团队背景信息不足"]}}, "raw": {"published": "2026-02-16T20:39:51Z", "ai_summary": {"tldr": "提出一种面向体育与舞台表演的“时间可归档”相机虚拟化神经渲染方法，在动态快速运动场景中实现更时空一致、逼真的新视角合成，并支持回看任意历史时刻重渲染。", "motivation": "现有动态3DGS/4DGS等方法依赖高质量SfM点云且难以应对大幅非刚体快速运动与多主体独立运动，导致跟踪假设被破坏、渲染不稳定；同时缺乏对过去时间点的可检索重放（time-archival）能力。", "method": "回到神经体渲染框架，将每个时间点的动态场景建模为跨多路同步相机视图的刚体变换组合，并在此表示上进行神经表示学习，以提升测试时的新视角渲染质量与时空一致性；同时将不同时间实例显式纳入表示以实现可归档查询与回放渲染。", "conclusion": "该方法在快节奏体育/演出等复杂动态场景下，相比基于高斯溅射的动态方案更稳健且具更高视觉质量，并首次（相对既有神经渲染/新视角合成工作）提供可回到任意历史时刻进行新视角重建的time-archival能力，适用于转播回放与分析归档。"}}}

Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications.

However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering.

A key design choice in GTs is the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based positional encodings to incorporate structural information. In this work, we study GTs through the lens of manifold limit models for graph sequences and establish a theoretical connection between GTs with GNN positional encodings and Manifold Neural Networks (MNNs). Building on transferability results for GNNs under manifold convergence, we show that GTs inherit transferability guarantees from their positional encodings. In particular, GTs trained on small graphs provably generalize to larger graphs under mild assumptions.

To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse.

BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark.

Currently, it remains unclear how to jointly learn reward functions from heterogeneous feedback types such as demonstrations, comparisons, ratings, and stops that provide qualitatively different signals. We address this challenge by formulating reward learning from multiple feedback types as Bayesian inference over a shared latent reward function, where each feedback type contributes information through an explicit likelihood. We introduce a scalable amortized variational inference approach that learns a shared reward encoder and feedback-specific likelihood decoders and is trained by optimizing a single evidence lower bound. Our approach avoids reducing feedback to a common intermediate representation and eliminates the need for manual loss balancing. Across discrete and continuous-control benchmarks, we show that jointly inferred reward posteriors outperform single-type baselines, exploit complementary information across feedback types, and yield policies that are more robust to environment perturbations.

To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path.

It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY.\nNext up, once you say \"go\", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.\nThere's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system.

In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement.

While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates.

Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans.

Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings.

In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains.

A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20.

As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data.

Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets.

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves.

Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence.

HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data.

GitNexus lets you *analyze* it — because a knowledge graph tracks every relationship, not just descriptions.\n*TL;DR:** The **Web UI** is a quick way to chat with any repo. The **CLI + MCP** is how you make your AI agent actually reliable — it gives Cursor, Claude Code, and friends a deep architectural view of your codebase so they stop missing dependencies, breaking call chains, and shipping blind edits.

This indexes the codebase, installs agent skills, registers Claude Code hooks, and creates / context files — all in one command.\nTo configure MCP for your editor, run once — or set it up manually below.\nMCP Setup\nauto-detects your editors and writes the correct global MCP config. You only need to run it once.\nEditor Support\n*Claude Code** gets the deepest integration: MCP tools + agent skills + PreToolUse hooks that automatically enrich grep/glob/bash calls with knowledge graph context.\nCommunity Integrations\nIf you prefer manual configuration:\n*Claude Code** (full support — MCP + skills + hooks):\n*Cursor** ( — global, works for all projects):\n*OpenCode** ( ):\nCLI Comma", "translated_description": "**GitNexus：零服务器的代码智能引擎** —— GitNexus 是一个完全在浏览器端运行的知识图谱生成器。只需导入一个 GitHub 仓库或 ZIP 文件，即可生成可交互的代码知识图谱，并内置 Graph RAG 智能代理，便于代码探索与理解。\n\n主要功能包括：本地（客户端）解析代码并构建知识图谱、图谱交互检索与问答/推理（Graph RAG Agent）。面向需要快速理解陌生代码库的开发者、代码审计/维护人员、技术负责人等场景，强调无需后端与数据不出本地的使用方式。核心技术为浏览器端图谱构建与检索增强生成（RAG），结合知识图谱上的结构化检索与大语言模型代理能力实现代码智能问答与导航。", "readme_summary_zh": "GitNexus 是一个零服务器的代码智能引擎：在浏览器端或通过 CLI 将 GitHub 仓库/ZIP 索引为知识图谱，覆盖依赖关系、调用链、聚类与执行流，并提供可交互的图谱与内置 Graph RAG 代理用于查询与分析。它面向需要快速理解与深入分析大型代码库的开发者，以及希望让 Cursor、Claude Code 等 AI 编程代理获得可靠上下文的用户。典型场景是代码探索、架构与影响分析、排查遗漏依赖/断裂调用链，减少代理“盲改”带来的错误。"}}

Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gráfico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates.

First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction.

These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information.

A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull. Across diverse benchmarks, including challenging homogeneous data setting, ECA consistently breaks the PCC plateau, achieving significant improvements in correlation without compromising MSE performance.", "description_zh": "论文从理论上解释了注意力回归训练中“PCC（皮尔逊相关）早早停滞而MSE继续下降”的原因，并提出ECA机制突破该相关性平台。", "keywords": ["注意力回归", "MSE-PCC 联合损失", "相关系数平台期", "相关系数梯度抑制", "优化动力学", "模型容量上限", "凸聚合器", "凸包约束", "数据同质性", "外推相关注意力（ECA）", "凸包外推"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Jingquan Yan", "Yuwei Miao", "Peiran Yu", "Junzhou Huang"]}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"is_ai": true, "hit_keywords": ["ai"], "hit_excludes": []}, "score": {"total": 28, "breakdown": {"ai_native": 6, "tech_niche": 17, "business": 2, "team": 3, "bonus": 0, "penalty": 0}, "reason": "偏学术论文：有理论分析与ECA改进但非Agent产品；无数据飞轮/在线学习/确定性工作流。商业与团队信息不足，落地与付费路径不清。", "reason_struct": {"summary": "技术上有亮点，但更像研究成果，缺少产品化闭环与商业要素。", "plus": ["对PCC平台期给出较严谨的优化动力学与容量上限解释", "提出ECA可外推突破凸包限制，针对同质数据场景有针对性"], "minus": ["无用户→数据标注/反馈闭环与在线自进化机制", "非确定性Agent工作流，缺少tool-use/memory/planning形态", "商业模式、目标用户与团队背景均信息不足"]}}, "raw": {"published": "2026-02-19T23:33:04Z", "ai_summary": {"tldr": "论文从理论上解释了注意力回归训练中“PCC（皮尔逊相关）早早停滞而MSE继续下降”的原因，并提出ECA机制突破该相关性平台。", "motivation": "现有注意力回归常联合优化MSE与PCC，但训练中PCC很快进入平台期、难以继续提升，现象普遍却缺乏严谨解释与有效改进手段。作者希望厘清其优化动力学与模型容量上的根本限制，并给出可突破限制的方法。", "method": "理论上分析联合损失下的梯度冲突：MSE下降会抑制PCC的梯度更新，且在输入同质、softmax注意力趋于平均/塌缩时问题更严重；进一步证明任何“凸聚合器”（含softmax注意力）的PCC提升受输入凸包严格约束。基于上述结论提出Extrapolative Correlation Attention（ECA），通过可“外推”超出凸包的机制与改进的相关性优化设计来提升PCC且不牺牲MSE。", "conclusion": "PCC平台期来自两类根因：优化层面的MSE↔PCC梯度冲突与softmax在同质数据下的放大效应，以及容量层面的凸聚合器凸包上界导致的PCC提升极限；数据同质性会同时加剧两者。实验表明ECA能稳定打破PCC平台，在多种基准（含高度同质场景）显著提升相关性并保持MSE性能。"}}}

Advancing SMMs to graph structured data, especially for large graphs, is a significant challenge because SSMs are sequence models and the shear graph volumes make it very expensive to convert graphs as sequences for effective learning. In this paper, we propose COMBA to tackle large graph learning using state space models, with two key innovations: graph context gating and cross batch aggregation. Graph context refers to different hops of neighborhood for each node, and graph context gating allows COMBA to use such context to learn best control of neighbor aggregation. For each graph context, COMBA samples nodes as batches, and train a graph neural network (GNN), with information being aggregated cross batches, allowing COMBA to scale to large graphs.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy.

Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization.

However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data.

Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.", "description_zh": "论文提出一个几何框架把扩散模型的噪声日程分为“小/中/大噪声”三段，指出记忆化风险主要集中在中等噪声段，并给出针对性的几何干预来缓解。", "keywords": ["Diffusion", "训练数据记忆化", "隐私泄露风险", "噪声调度", "中等噪声危险区", "数据几何", "高斯壳覆盖", "后验分布集中", "线性高斯去噪", "定向干预缓解"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Nick Dodson", "Xinyu Gao", "Qingsong Wang", "Yusu Wang", "Zhengchao Wan"]}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"is_ai": true, "hit_keywords": ["ai", "diffusion", "rag"], "hit_excludes": []}, "score": {"total": 18, "breakdown": {"ai_native": 2, "tech_niche": 14, "business": 1, "team": 1, "bonus": 0, "penalty": 0}, "reason": "学术论文型成果：提出扩散记忆化的几何分段与中噪声危险区及干预，技术洞见尚可；但无产品/Agent闭环、无数据飞轮与在线自进化设计，商业模式与团队信息不足，难评估落地与退出。", "reason_struct": {"summary": "扩散模型记忆化机理研究，有方法论贡献，但缺少产品与商业/团队要素。", "plus": ["提出噪声日程三段几何框架，定位中噪声记忆化高风险区", "给出几何条件下的定向干预思路，具备潜在安全/隐私应用价值"], "minus": ["非AI Native/Agent产品：无确定性工作流、工具调用、记忆/规划体系与在线学习闭环", "无私有数据飞轮与niche商业化路径描述", "团队背景、目标用户与付费/集成模式信息不足"]}}, "raw": {"published": "2026-02-19T21:21:13Z", "ai_summary": {"tldr": "论文提出一个几何框架把扩散模型的噪声日程分为“小/中/大噪声”三段，指出记忆化风险主要集中在中等噪声段，并给出针对性的几何干预来缓解。", "motivation": "扩散模型可能记忆训练样本带来隐私风险，但现有理解不清楚“记忆化在噪声日程的哪个阶段发生”、数据几何如何影响以及不同噪声尺度现象如何相互作用。", "method": "基于两类关键几何对象——训练数据被高斯壳覆盖的性质与后验分布的集中行为——将噪声日程划分为三个机制不同的区间，并据此分析各区间的记忆化倾向；在中噪声区提出满足特定几何条件的“定向干预”以抑制记忆化。", "conclusion": "记忆化风险在噪声水平上高度不均匀：中等噪声存在最危险的“记忆化区”；小噪声因训练覆盖不足而不易记忆，大噪声因后验不集中且去噪近似线性高斯而天然抗记忆，并可通过几何引导的干预降低中噪声段的记忆风险。"}}}

We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals.

Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.   In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.   Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints.

Generating DP synthetic data typically involves a difficult trade-off. On one hand, DP finetuning methods train an LLM as a synthetic data generator with formal privacy guarantees, yet it still requires the raw content of private examples for model training. However, methods that avoid direct exposure to private data are bounded by an off-the-shelf, un-finetuned model, whose outputs often lack domain fidelity. Can we train an LLM to generate high-quality synthetic text without eyes-on access to individual private examples? In this work, we introduce Differentially Private Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (DP-RFT), an online reinforcement learning algorithm for synthetic data generation with LLMs. DP-RFT leverages DP-protected nearest-neighbor votes from an eyes-off private corpus as a reward signal for on-policy synthetic samples generated by an LLM. The LLM iteratively learns to generate synthetic data to maximize the expected DP votes through Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We evaluate DP-RFT for long-form and domain-specific synthetic data generation, such as news articles, meeting transcripts, and medical article abstracts.

While substantial research has focused on architectural improvements, the impact of patch size, a crucial initial design choice in ViTs, remains underexplored, particularly in medical domains where both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities exist.   In this study, using 12 medical imaging datasets from various imaging modalities (including seven 2D and five 3D datasets), we conduct a thorough evaluation of how different patch sizes affect ViT classification performance. Using a single graphical processing unit (GPU) and a range of patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28), we fine-tune ViT models and observe consistent improvements in classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, and 4), which achieve the best results across nearly all datasets.

We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks.

Recent studies have demonstrated decoding of locomotion kinematics across species on motorized treadmills. However, efforts to decode locomotion speed in more natural contexts$-$where pace is self-selected rather than externally imposed$-$are scarce, generally achieve only modest accuracy, and require intracranial implants. Here, we aim to decode self-paced locomotion speed non-invasively and continuously using cortex-wide EEG recordings from rats. $\\textit{Approach.}$ We introduce an asynchronous brain$-$computer interface (BCI) that processes a stream of 32-electrode skull-surface EEG (0.01$-$45 Hz) to decode instantaneous speed from a non-motorized treadmill during self-paced locomotion in head-fixed rats. Using recurrent neural networks and a dataset of over 133 h of recordings, we trained decoders to map ongoing EEG activity to treadmill speed. $\\textit{Main results.}$ Our decoding achieves a correlation of 0.88 ($R^2$ = 0.78) for speed, primarily driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency ($< 8$ Hz) oscillations. Moreover, pre-training on a single session permitted decoding on other sessions from the same rat, suggesting uniform neural signatures that generalize across sessions but fail to transfer across animals. Finally, we found that cortical states not only carry information about current speed, but also about future and past dynamics, extending up to 1000 ms. $\\textit{Significance.}$ These findings demonstrate that self-paced locomotion speed can be decoded accurately and continuously from non-invasive, cortex-wide EEG.

Teaching a model new capabilities requires modifying those same weights, inevitably degrading previously acquired knowledge. This fundamental limitation, known as catastrophic forgetting, has resisted principled solutions for decades. Existing approaches treat weights as immutable artifacts that must be protected through techniques like regularization heuristics, replay buffers, or isolated adapter modules. The problem is none of these provide a structural guarantee against forgetting. In this work, we propose Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF), a framework that replaces the fixed weight paradigm with a learned function that generates weight configurations on demand from a continuous capability coordinate space.

We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapTab, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs via route planning tasks. MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries.

It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY.\nNext up, once you say \"go\", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.\nThere's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system.

Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship.

Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead.

Existing approaches either rely on multiple agents, incurring high coordination and resource costs, or adopt a single-agent paradigm, which overloads the agent with both global planning and local perception, often leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon settings. To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation. Extensive evaluations on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R demonstrate that DACo achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over the best-performing baselines in zero-shot settings, and generalizes effectively across both closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source (e.g., Qwen-VL Series) backbones.

Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction.

Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime.

However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations.

Data collection involved 60,000 raw posts from various Persian social media platforms, followed by rigorous preprocessing and hybrid annotation combining ChatGPT-based few-shot prompting with human verification. To mitigate class imbalance, we employed undersampling with semantic redundancy removal and advanced data augmentation strategies integrating lexical replacement and generative prompting.

However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training.

Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task.

Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space.

These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks.

In this work, we hypothesize the existence of fixed golden layers that can achieve near-optimal editing performance similar to sample-wise optimal layers. To validate this hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence by comparing golden layers against ground-truth sample-wise optimal layers.

However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL).

However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.", "description_zh": "提出一种结合主动感知的互补学习系统（CLS）：让“快速学习器”放弃泛化、专注于去纠缠的情景推理，并借助“慢速学习器”的统计泛化来实现持续的零样本与小样本学习。", "keywords": ["持续学习", "零样本学习", "小样本学习", "互补学习系统（CLS）", "情景记忆", "解耦表示", "表征纠缠", "灾难性干扰", "主动感知", "快慢学习器", "上下文偏置"], "tags": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "metrics": {"authors": ["David Rawlinson", "Gideon Kowadlo"]}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"is_ai": true, "hit_keywords": ["ai", "machine learning", "rag", "context"], "hit_excludes": []}, "score": {"total": 26, "breakdown": {"ai_native": 8, "tech_niche": 14, "business": 2, "team": 2, "bonus": 0, "penalty": 0}, "reason": "偏学术架构论文：快慢学习器+主动感知有一定非共识技术亮点，但无用户数据标注/在线自进化闭环，也非确定性交付工作流。商业模式、目标用户、团队背景与落地形态信息不足，整体投资可评性弱。", "reason_struct": {"summary": "学术型持续学习架构创新，但缺产品化与商业/团队信息", "plus": ["提出CLS快慢系统+主动感知耦合，面向持续/零小样本学习，技术路线有一定独特性"], "minus": ["无用户交互产生数据对与训练/评估/策略修正闭环，缺自进化机制", "非Agent确定性工作流交付形态，更偏模型结构研究", "商业模式、定价、1%高价值用户与退出路径信息不足", "团队成员背景、复合认知与迭代能力信息不足"]}}, "raw": {"published": "2026-02-22T22:05:02Z", "ai_summary": {"tldr": "提出一种结合主动感知的互补学习系统（CLS）：让“快速学习器”放弃泛化、专注于去纠缠的情景推理，并借助“慢速学习器”的统计泛化来实现持续的零样本与小样本学习。", "motivation": "追求强泛化往往会在类别边界形成纠缠表征，导致在持续学习或小样本学习所需的快速大幅更新时发生灾难性干扰；而现有不干扰的快速学习方法又常缺乏泛化能力。", "method": "构建并行的快慢双系统：快学习器用去纠缠表征进行情景驱动的快速推理（不追求泛化），并在主动感知框架中提供上下文偏置，引导慢学习器用已学到的泛化概念对新刺激进行编码，从而在观测噪声/不确定性下实现零/小样本识别与学习。", "conclusion": "通过让快速系统专注于不干扰的情景推理、慢速系统专注于结构化泛化，并用主动感知把两者耦合，可在同一架构中同时获得鲁棒的持续学习能力与零/小样本学习表现。"}}}

While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools. Experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench show consistent gains on unseen tools, strong cross-domain generalization, and robustness as the number of candidate tools scales to over 100, demonstrating that tool interface optimization is a practical and deployable complement to agent fine-tuning.", "description_zh": "提出Trace-Free+通过“重写工具描述/接口”而非只微调Agent，在无执行轨迹条件下也能显著提升LLM-Agent的工具选择与调用可靠性。", "keywords": ["工具接口优化", "工具描述重写", "参数模式设计", "无执行轨迹学习", "课程学习", "冷启动部署", "隐私受限训练", "大规模工具选择", "跨域泛化", "未见工具泛化"], "tags": ["cs.AI"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Ruocheng Guo", "Kaiwen Dong", "Xiang Gao", "Kamalika Das"]}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"is_ai": true, "hit_keywords": ["ai", "llm", "agent", "rag", "workflow"], "hit_excludes": []}, "score": {"total": 42, "breakdown": {"ai_native": 14, "tech_niche": 18, "business": 3, "team": 3, "bonus": 4, "penalty": 0}, "reason": "偏Agent Infra：通过重写工具描述/Schema提升工具调用可靠性，并构建高质量接口数据集，具跨域泛化与规模优势；但更像研究方法，缺少用户数据闭环、商业化与团队信息。", "reason_struct": {"summary": "工具接口优化（trace-free）作为Agent可靠性补强的研究型项目，技术有差异化但产品与商业要素缺失。", "plus": ["从“微调Agent”转向“优化工具接口”，属于非共识但贴近Agent演进方向", "结构化流程构建大规模高质量工具接口数据，对未见工具泛化与大候选集稳健", "可作为Agent Infra/模块被集成，具平台型潜质雏形"], "minus": ["未体现用户在使用中形成标注/反馈数据对系统自进化的闭环（online learning不明确）", "缺少商业模式、付费绑定、目标用户与落地场景描述", "团队背景与迭代能力信息不足，无法高分评估"]}}, "raw": {"published": "2026-02-23T23:50:24Z", "ai_summary": {"tldr": "提出Trace-Free+通过“重写工具描述/接口”而非只微调Agent，在无执行轨迹条件下也能显著提升LLM-Agent的工具选择与调用可靠性。", "motivation": "现有工具接口多为人类设计，面对上百候选工具时会成为LLM-Agent使用瓶颈；而基于执行轨迹的接口优化在冷启动或隐私受限场景常不可用，且逐工具优化难以扩展到未见工具。", "method": "Trace-Free+采用课程学习，把监督从“有轨迹训练”逐步迁移到“无轨迹部署”设置，促使模型抽象可复用的接口使用模式与结果导向信号；同时通过结构化流程构建大规模高质量工具接口数据，用于学习自动重写工具描述与参数schema以更适配Agent。", "conclusion": "在StableToolBench与RestBench上，该方法对未见工具持续提升、跨域泛化强，并在候选工具规模扩大到100+时仍保持稳健，表明工具接口优化是可部署且能补充Agent微调的有效路径。"}}}

To address this problem, we propose a novel diffusion-based planning method, termed as Diffusion Modulation via Environment Mechanism Modeling (DMEMM).

Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors promise high-quality imaging in regimes where conventional cameras fail, but raw \\emph{quanta frames} contain only sparse, noisy, binary photon detections. Recovering a coherent image from a burst of such frames requires handling alignment, denoising, and demosaicing (for color) under noise statistics far outside those assumed by standard restoration pipelines or modern generative models. We present an approach that adapts large text-to-image latent diffusion models to the photon-limited domain of quanta burst imaging. Our method leverages the structural and semantic priors of internet-scale diffusion models while introducing mechanisms to handle Bernoulli photon statistics. By integrating latent-space restoration with burst-level spatio-temporal reasoning, our approach produces reconstructions that are both photometrically faithful and perceptually pleasing, even under high-speed motion. We evaluate the method on synthetic benchmarks and new real-world datasets, including the first color SPAD burst dataset and a challenging \\textit{Deforming (XD)} video benchmark. Across all settings, the approach substantially improves perceptual quality over classical and modern learning-based baselines, demonstrating the promise of adapting large generative priors to extreme photon-limited sensing.

Yet, these models remain fragile under domain shifts, especially when adapting from synthetic to real-world point clouds. Conventional 3D domain adaptation approaches rely on heavy trainable encoders, yielding strong accuracy but at the cost of efficiency. We introduce CLIPoint3D, the first framework for few-shot unsupervised 3D point cloud domain adaptation built upon CLIP. Our approach projects 3D samples into multiple depth maps and exploits the frozen CLIP backbone, refined through a knowledge-driven prompt tuning scheme that integrates high-level language priors with geometric cues from a lightweight 3D encoder. To adapt task-specific features effectively, we apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning to CLIP's encoders and design an entropy-guided view sampling strategy for selecting confident projections. Furthermore, an optimal transport-based alignment loss and an uncertainty-aware prototype alignment loss collaboratively bridge source-target distribution gaps while maintaining class separability. Extensive experiments on PointDA-10 and GraspNetPC-10 benchmarks show that CLIPoint3D achieves consistent 3-16% accuracy gains over both CLIP-based and conventional encoder-based baselines.

However, such services are highly vulnerable to Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs), where an adversary repeatedly queries a target model to collect input-output pairs and uses them to train a surrogate model that closely replicates its functionality. While numerous defense strategies have been proposed, verifying the ownership of a suspicious model with strict theoretical guarantees remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce CREDIT, a certified ownership verification against MEAs.

However, deploying large-scale GNN models locally is particularly challenging for users, as it requires significant computational resources and extensive property data. Consequently, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become increasingly popular, offering a convenient way to deploy and access various models, including GNNs. However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality. Specifically, attackers repeatedly query the target model using subgraph inputs to collect corresponding responses. These input-output pairs are subsequently utilized to train their own surrogate models at minimal cost. Many techniques have been proposed to defend against MEAs, but most are limited to specific output levels (e.g., embedding or label) and suffer from inherent technical drawbacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ownership verification framework CITED which is a first-of-its-kind method to achieve ownership verification on both embedding and label levels. Moreover, CITED is a novel signature-based method that neither harms downstream performance nor introduces auxiliary models that reduce efficiency, while still outperforming all watermarking and fingerprinting approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our CITED framework.

Building on recent work on coverage-based exploration, we introduce a parameterized family of decomposable and concave objective functions $U_κ$ that explicitly incorporate both intrinsic estimation complexity and extrinsic visitation frequency. Moreover, the curvature $κ$ provides a unified treatment of various global objectives, such as the average-case and worst-case estimation error objectives. Using the closed-form characterization of the gradient of $U_κ$, we propose $κ$-Explorer, an active exploration algorithm that performs Frank-Wolfe-style optimization over state-action occupancy measures. The diminishing-returns structure of $U_κ$ naturally prioritizes underexplored and high-variance transitions, while preserving smoothness properties that enable efficient optimization.

However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation.

Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance.

At the same time, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spawned the study of mechanistic interpretability, which aims to identify granular model components like circuits that perform specific computations. In this work, we introduce Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (MINAR), an efficient circuit discovery toolbox that adapts attribution patching methods from mechanistic interpretability to the GNN setting.

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications.

First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift.

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength.

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price.

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings.

It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY.\nNext up, once you say \"go\", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.\nThere's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system.
