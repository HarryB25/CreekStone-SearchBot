Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics.

We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass.

Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective.

While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention.

Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2).

Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting.   Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $γ_n^{1/6}$, where $γ_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$.

Empirically, on task-incremental diffusion image generation and continual diffusion-policy control, trust region continual learning achieves the best final performance and retention, and consistently recovers early-task performance faster than EWC, replay, and continual meta-learning baselines.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种信任区域持续学习方法，结合生成重放和Fisher度量约束，显著提高了模型在连续学习中的性能和任务保留能力。", "keywords": ["信任区域持续学习", "元学习", "生成回放", "任务增量", "深度学习", "机器学习", "神经网络", "任务优化", "性能保留", "ml"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Zekun Wang", "Anant Gupta", "Christopher J.

While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection.", "description_zh": "提出了一种新的主动学习种子数据选择方法ATBagging，结合了迁移学习和袋装模型，以提高数据获取效率。", "keywords": ["主动学习", "迁移学习", "数据集", "信息增益", "特征选择", "Active-Transfer Bagging", "低数据场景", "预测分布", "多样性采样", "machine learning"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Vivienne Pelletier", "Daniel J.

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient.

In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result.

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant.

While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种名为PULSE的高效稀疏权重同步方法，显著减少了带宽需求，同时保持训练性能。", "keywords": ["权重更新稀疏性", "强化学习", "分布式RL", "大语言模型", "PULSE", "通信效率", "参数同步", "训练动态", "带宽约束", "llm"], "tags": ["cs.LG"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Erfan Miahi", "Eugene Belilovsky"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "llm", "rag"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 25, "bonus": 5, "business": 14, "penalty": 0, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "项目提出了PULSE方法，展现出强大的自我改进能力和数据反馈机制，符合AI原生标准。技术路径解决了带宽瓶颈问题，具备可持续的行业壁垒。商业模式与高价值用户紧密结合，团队背景信息不足，未能加分。", "total": 72}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "PULSE在带宽限制的去中心化环境中实现了超过100倍的通信减少，保持了与全权重同步相同的训练动态和性能。", "method": "PULSE方法通过传输修改参数的索引和值，利用权重更新的稀疏性，避免了浮点数漂移和传输错误。", "motivation": "在带宽受限的分布式强化学习中，策略权重的同步常成为扩展性的瓶颈，尤其是在商品网络或去中心化环境中。", "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为PULSE的高效稀疏权重同步方法，显著减少了带宽需求，同时保持训练性能。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-03T18:56:48Z", "tagline": null}}

To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods.

Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts.

A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines.

Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization.

Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression.

We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\\sqrt{m})$ in expectation.

This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan.

We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels.

To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers.

We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning.

Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种新颖的邻域描述符LitS，用于准确表征点云的局部几何特征。", "keywords": ["点云", "邻域描述符", "3D扫描", "几何特征", "LitS", "机器学习", "深度学习", "语义搜索", "自适应算法", "数据分析", "rag"], "tags": ["cs.CV"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Jonatan B.

In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction.

Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning.

Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster.

We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments.

The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF).

Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking.

However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method.

Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck.

A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions.

These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects.

Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy.

To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.", "description_zh": "本研究提出了一种地理感知的基于Transformer的交通预测模型，以提高城市高速公路的交通预测准确性。", "keywords": ["深度学习", "Transformer", "交通预测", "数字双胞胎", "时序数据", "地理信息", "实时数据", "机器学习", "预测模型"], "tags": ["cs.AI"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Krešimir Kušić", "Vinny Cahill", "Ivana Dusparic"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "machine learning", "transformer"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 20, "bonus": 0, "business": 12, "penalty": 5, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "该项目在AI原生程度上表现一般，虽然提出了新模型，但缺乏自我改进机制。技术路径具有独特性，解决复杂问题，商业模式较弱且未明确高价值用户。团队背景信息不足，减分因创始人早于1990年。", "total": 65}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "实验结果表明，使用互信息增强地理感知可以提高GATTF模型的预测准确性，相较于标准Transformer模型，复杂度未增加。", "method": "提出的GATTF模型利用分布式传感器之间的互信息来捕捉地理关系，改善交通预测性能。", "motivation": "高速公路数字双胞胎技术的有效性依赖于高分辨率实时交通数据的持续流动，同时需结合预测的交通状况以支持决策。", "tldr": "本研究提出了一种地理感知的基于Transformer的交通预测模型，以提高城市高速公路的交通预测准确性。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-05T18:33:03Z", "tagline": null}}

In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference.

These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines.

We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench.

To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects.

Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge.

By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \\textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.", "description_zh": "本文提出了一种名为Context Forcing的新框架，通过长上下文教师训练长上下文学生，从而提升视频生成的一致性和有效性。", "keywords": ["视频生成", "长期一致性", "上下文管理", "深度学习", "生成模型", "长期依赖", "Slow-Fast Memory", "训练框架", "监督匹配", "rag"], "tags": ["cs.CV"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Shuo Chen", "Cong Wei", "Sun Sun", "Ping Nie", "Kai Zhou", "Ge Zhang", "Ming-Hsuan Yang", "Wenhu Chen"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "rag", "context"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 20, "bonus": 6, "business": 12, "penalty": 0, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "该项目在视频生成领域提出了长上下文教师的创新方法，具备一定的自我改进能力，技术路径独特，符合行业需求，但商业模式尚不明确，团队信息不足。", "total": 68}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "实验结果显示，该方法在生成超过20秒的长视频时，显著超越了现有技术，提升了长时间一致性。", "method": "Context Forcing框架通过引入长上下文教师，消除监督不匹配，并使用Slow-Fast Memory架构来管理和优化上下文处理。", "motivation": "现有视频生成方法存在学生与教师之间的短期和长期上下文不匹配问题，限制了模型的生成能力。", "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为Context Forcing的新框架，通过长上下文教师训练长上下文学生，从而提升视频生成的一致性和有效性。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-05T18:58:01Z", "tagline": null}}

Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation.

The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model.

In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference.

These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods.

Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines.

We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench.

To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects.

Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency.

These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy.

These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German.

We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving.

To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects.

To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation.

Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation.

In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy.

Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants.

Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces.

We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories.

Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture.

During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction.

We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models.

We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate.

True intelligence relies on \"world models\" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations.

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network.

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy.

However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain.", "description_zh": "提出了一种名为GAD-MoRE的框架，通过混合黎曼专家实现零-shot图异常检测，显著提升跨域泛化能力。", "keywords": ["图神经网络", "异常检测", "零-shot学习", "里曼专家", "多曲率特征对齐", "结构签名", "跨域泛化", "动态路由", "机器学习", "深度学习", "embedding"], "tags": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Xinyu Zhao", "Qingyun Sun", "Jiayi Luo", "Xingcheng Fu", "Jianxin Li"], "featured": null, "forks": null, "stars": null, "stars_today": null, "votes": null}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"hit_excludes": [], "hit_keywords": ["ai", "embedding"], "is_ai": true}, "score": {"breakdown": {"ai_native": 20, "bonus": 6, "business": 12, "penalty": 0, "team": 10, "tech_niche": 18}, "reason": "项目提出了创新的混合黎曼专家框架，提升了图异常检测的跨域泛化能力，具备一定的技术壁垒。但缺乏明确的商业模式和团队背景信息，整体评分受限。", "total": 70}, "raw": {"ai_summary": {"conclusion": "GAD-MoRE在零-shot设置下显著超越了现有的通用图异常检测基线，甚至超过了在目标领域用标签数据进行少量微调的竞争对手。", "method": "GAD-MoRE利用多个专门的黎曼专家网络在不同曲率空间中建模异常模式，并引入异常感知的多曲率特征对齐模块和基于记忆的动态路由器以优化输入分配。", "motivation": "现有零-shot图异常检测方法未能充分考虑不同异常模式的几何差异，限制了其跨域泛化能力。", "tldr": "提出了一种名为GAD-MoRE的框架，通过混合黎曼专家实现零-shot图异常检测，显著提升跨域泛化能力。"}, "created_at": null, "published": "2026-02-06T16:46:30Z", "tagline": null}}

In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{RoBoS}}$-NN.

We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance.

In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy.

To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping.

Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants.

Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces.

In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy.

To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories.

Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction.

Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking.

Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection.

While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations.

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network.

We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset.

Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance.

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining.

However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies.

We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution.

While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks.

In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering.

So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model.

ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework.

In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder.

To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability.

ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.", "description_zh": "ADORA是一种新的政策优化框架，通过动态调整优势函数的权重，改善强化学习模型的收敛速度和学习稳定性。", "keywords": ["强化学习", "代理", "优势估计", "策略优化", "ADORA", "在线学习", "动态调整", "数据差异化", "收益模型", "ml"], "tags": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "metrics": {"authors": ["Qingnan Ren", "Shiting Huang", "Zhen Fang", "Zehui Chen", "Lin Chen", "Lijun Li", "Feng Zhao"]}, "media": {"image": null}, "ai_flags": {"is_ai": true, "hit_keywords": ["ai", "ml"], "hit_excludes": []}, "score": {"total": 70, "breakdown": {"ai_native": 25, "tech_niche": 18, "business": 10, "team": 10, "bonus": 6, "penalty": 0}, "reason": "项目提出了一种动态调整优势函数的框架，具备自我改进能力，适应性强，符合AI原生标准。技术路径独特，解决了强化学习中的复杂问题，具有一定的行业壁垒。商业模式尚不明确，团队信息不足。"}, "raw": {"published": "2026-02-10T17:40:39Z", "ai_summary": {"tldr": "ADORA是一种新的政策优化框架，通过动态调整优势函数的权重，改善强化学习模型的收敛速度和学习稳定性。", "motivation": "传统的静态优势估计方法导致信贷分配效率低下，从而影响模型在复杂任务中的表现。", "method": "ADORA通过在线回滚适应，动态分类训练数据为暂时有利和不利样本，从而优化优势函数的估计。", "conclusion": "ADORA显著提高了几何和数学任务中的推理能力，且在不需敏感超参数调整的情况下，一致地实现了性能提升。"}}}
